# stocks_forex_analyzer
Develop a web-based AI-powered trading analyzer incorporating Wayne McDonell’s and Michael J. Huddleston’s (ICT) trading strategies, using the MERN stack, TypeScript, Docker, TradingView, GitHub Actions, and TensorFlow.js. Each feature will be developed in a separate Git branch, tested, and merged into the main branch upon successful validation.
